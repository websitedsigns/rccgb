  <p><strong>Roller Coasters</strong> - The King of the theme parks.</p>
  <p>The new steel high-tech marvels now rise more than four hundred feet in the air with loops, 
    corkscrews, boomerangs and other white-knuckle elements. 
    All over the world they reach speeds of over 100mph with eager thrill seekers being able 
    to ride sitting, standing or even suspended beneath the track. So where it all start?</p>
  <p>Well the roots are still with us today - lattice wooden structures, steep rises, swooping 
    drops and loads of shake, rattle and roll! Modern steel looping roller coasters and 
    traditional wooden roller coasters may look different, but they still have one thing 
    in common; they both exist to excite and thrill the riders.</p>
  <p>It all began in the 15th and 16th century with Russian Mountains. These were ice 
    slides constructed in Russian towns, some even as high as 70 feet! Both the track and 
    sleds were made of ice, with the seating being straw stuffed in chiselled hollows. 
    The first roller coaster with wheels was invented in Russia also, built in 1784 in St. Petersburg. 
    Soon after, the rides made their way to Paris, where the first coaster attraction 
    was opened in 1804. There were of course problems in these early days. Wheels often 
    fell off and the cars did not always stop at the end of the track!</p>
  <p>It was in Paris where the phrase "roller coaster" originated. The early rides used tracks 
    made of rollers and sleds with runners - creating roller coasting. The name then remained 
    after runners were replaced with wheels.</p>
  <p>The first ride to resemble modern roller coasters as we know them today, opened in Paris in
     1817. Called Promenades Aeriennes (Aerial Walks), it had two separate, continuous tracks and
      the cars were locked onto the track. The first roller coaster in America was the Gravity 
      Pleasure Switchback Railway built by La Marcus Thompson in 1884 at Coney Island, New York. 
      The ride reached six miles per hour and riders sat sideways.</p>
  <p>Inventors and designers were soon working to make coasters better and faster and in the 50's
     tubular steel track was being used allowing riders to eventually be turned upside down. Now 
     as theme park attendances rise, wooden coasters have become popular once again, too. These 
     grand visions of the past now reach greater speeds and heights and can match their steel 
     counterparts for extreme thrills. The Club continually strives to encourage UK manufacturers 
     to build new wooden roller coasters to compliment their steel counterparts.</p>
  <p>Today there are over 2400 different coasters in the world. Parks all over the world compete
     to build the highest, the longest and the fastest rides. Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio (USA) 
     a coaster enthusiasts dream with no less than 17 on offer, is home to Top Thrill Dragsters, 
     a 420ft high steel coaster that reaches speeds of 120mph. In Australia they have T
     he Tower of Terror, a 300ft free fall ride. Ring Racer in Germany hits 135mph and in the UK, 
     Thorpe Park attracts riders with its record breaking 10 inversion coaster named Colossus. 
     New designs are being introduced all the time. In recent years coasters have had their track 
     turned upside down and the cars suspended underneath. Some coasters coaster have no seats 
     and riders stand held in by special harnesses and more recently new 'laying down' coasters 
     has been introduced. It seems that as long as we crave for more thrills the more the 
     manufacturers try and give it to us.</p>
  <p>This level of enthusiasm is shared the world over and roller coasters have a mass following.
     So in August 1988, The Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain was created. The main aims were 
     to unite coaster enthusiasts in a social way, promote amusement parks as fun and safe places 
     and encourage parks and manufacturers to create and install new and more exciting and daring 
     rides.</p>
  <p>Since then membership has grown and currently has well over 1000 members in around 15 different 
    countries. These coaster crazy members go to great lengths to get their coaster fix. The average 
    Club member will have ridden over 100 different coasters, spent 8 hours in each park they have 
    visited and ridden around 40 times in one day! Some of the longer term members who have done 
    many Club trips, especially abroad have now ridden well over 1000 different coasters worldwide!</p>
  <p>Since the first club events back in the late 1980's they have remained the key part of being 
    a member. Each year the club organises at least 6 events. These include favourites such as the 
    'Blackpool Bash', 'Loopathon', 'Mega-GLOW-Mania' and 'Summer Bash'. European trips have also 
    been part of the trip calendar in past years with visits to Port Aventura, Six Flags Holland 
    and Europa Park to name just a few. In 1993 the club did its first trip to the 
    United States of America and this has since become a yearly event with one or two coach 
    loads of members riding around 80-100 coasters in a 2 week trip!</p>
  <p>So what about the future? How high or fast can roller coasters get? Well, the limits are 
    really set by what the average human being can take. There comes a point where your body 
    cannot take the extreme forces any longer and the ride no longer becomes fun. And the key 
    word in the whole of the amusement industry is 'fun'. People visit parks to enjoy themselves, 
    and forget about their daily troubles. You can go to work from Monday to Friday but come the 
    weekend you can get away from it all and enter another world. A world of fun! Everywhere you 
    look in a theme park people are smiling, laughing and of course screaming, with delight!</p>
  <p>More and more coasters are appearing all over the world. Being a member of the RCCGB will 
    mean that you get invitations to various Club trips to try out these new coasters. Attending 
    trips is also the best way to make new friends who all share the same great pastime. Remember, 
    on a Club trip each and every member is there to have a good time and within short while you'll
     soon feel part of the 'Coaster Crazy' crowd!</p>
  <p>So no matter what other thrill rides or adrenalin activities are invented, roller 
    coasters will always be the King of the park and as a Club we will always do our best to
     preserve existing coasters and encourage construction of new ones!</p>
  <p><em>The ride may only last two minutes, but the memories last a lifetime!

      <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold mt-4">RCCGB Riders Code of Conduct</h4>

      <p>
        The Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain has for 30 years promoted the amusement park industry as a <strong>fun and safe recreation</strong>. We strive to promote safe riding at all times.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RCCGB has a <strong>'Riders Code of Conduct'</strong> and will take action against any member who does not share the same level of importance on safety. This would include any form of unsafe riding, such as, keeping lap bars loose, removing seat belts, taking cameras on rides where not permitted, etc. The negative publicity of rule breaking is immense and damaging to the industry and also tarnishes the good reputation of established enthusiast groups who have spent many years building good and trusted relationships with parks all over the world.
      </p>

      <p class="text-danger fw-bold">
        Any member found riding in an unsafe manner or actively breaking published parks rules will be immediately expelled from the RCCGB's organised event (if applicable) and membership may be revoked. This is in addition to any park sanctions. By joining the RCCGB and booking any organised events you are accepting the RCCGB Riders Code of Conduct.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am pleased to say that since the Club's formation in 1988 no action has ever had to be taken against members. Let's keep this up and continue to promote the industry as fun and safe and ensure the RCCGB remains one of the industry's most popular coaster enthusiasts Clubs all over the world.
